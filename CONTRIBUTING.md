# Contributing to MqDockerUp

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MqDockerUp. It's people like you that make MqDockerUp such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to search if someone hasn't already reported the issue. If the issue doesn't already exist, create a new issue.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix or implement, then fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

\```bash
git checkout -b feature-325-fix-thestuff
\```

## Make a Pull Request

Make a Pull Request (PR).

## Wait for your PR to be reviewed

I will look over your contribution and either merge it, request changes, or give feedback. If the PR is not suitable or necessary, it may be closed. But, don't worry! Every contribution is valuable and getting feedback can help you make even better contributions in the future!

## Guidelines

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
